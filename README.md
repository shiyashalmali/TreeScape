TreeScape
Overview

The Tree Enumeration Project is an automated machine learning solution designed to analyze aerial and satellite imagery for environmental insights. This project enables efficient identification, classification, and enumeration of trees, along with assessing green land and idle land distribution within a given area.

Key Features

Tree Identification & Counting: Detects and counts individual trees in aerial images.

Tree Type Classification: Classifies tree species using machine learning models.

Land Analysis: Calculates the percentage of green land vs. idle land.

Scalable & Efficient: Designed to handle large-scale environmental assessments.

Data Visualization: Provides visual outputs for better decision-making.

Use Cases

Urban Planning: Helps in city planning by analyzing green cover distribution.

Deforestation Monitoring: Tracks changes in forest cover over time.

Ecological Studies: Assists in biodiversity research and conservation efforts.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.

Machine Learning (YOLOv8): Used for tree detection and classification.

OpenCV: Image processing for feature extraction.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Flask/Django (Optional): Web-based interface for analysis.
